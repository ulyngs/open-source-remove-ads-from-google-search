<p>`Highlight Ads on Google.com` works in a very simple manner: it injects a style sheet to google.com which locally applies a background color to search results that are ads.</p>

<p>After you have installed this app, the extension will appear in <strong>Safari > Preferences... > Extensions </strong>. Here, you can turn the extension off and on - or uninstall it.</p> 

<p>If you have any problems, contact me at ulrik.lyngs@gmail.com or create a GitHub issue on the repository <a href="https://github.com/ulyngs/highlight-ads-on-google/">github.com/ulyngs/highlight-ads-on-google/</a>.</p>
